# Abstract View
This program uses Php, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am creating this program for a variety of reasons. One, I want to test my self and see what I can do. Two, I'm building this program for someone. Three, I want this program to be useful for others. What this program will do once finished is help someone study for a class. The user will be able to enter in their own questions which can vary from true/ false, multiple choice, or question/ answer. They will also be able to edit previously entered questions. The program will have two modes of studying. One, they can use study mode which will constantly test them against the provided questions they entered and keep track of which ones they answer wrong most frequently. Mode two will be a periodic mode. The user will be able to surf the internet and questions will be prompted at set intervals. The set interval can be adjusted in the settings.

# Full View (Beta)
As of right now the program doesn't include all the features mentioned in the abstract but the program is more than capable of being something the user can currently use. 

As of now you are able to add in cards either true/ false, multiple choice, or question/ answer. I kind of have a bug I should probably fix where if the user adds a card sucessfully and keeps on pressing refresh. That card will keep on being added to the deck which I kind of left in now more testing purposes but really sure be fixed.

True/ false and question/ answer work in a typical fashion that you may expect. Multiple choice is unique that I put a lot a effort into making. You can have up to nine options a minium of one. Of course you cant really have a multiple choice with only one option so this will probably be fixed in the future. Whats unique about the the multiple choice is that you are able to have more than one correct answer but all correct answers have to be selected to get the question right.

# Future Ideas
I will create a way for the user to be able to make a set of cards for individual classes, subjects, or tests. They will also have a way to combine decks to be studied up against.

The user wants to be able to make actual flash cards that they can flip and flop. I have a few ideas. I will give the user the option to include flash cards while testing which might be a check box they can click for the option or I'll have several check boxes if the user only wants certain things to be tested on. Example only True/ False or True/ False and multiple choice. This will be made possible with check boxes on the testing page or in a settings page. Things might get crazy if the user wants to constantly change these options on the test page. Might be best to keep this only in settings page.

Create a home page where the user can pick a deck, add a new deck, delete a deck, or combine decks. I don't think I really need to make user accounts since this isn't on the actual web but if users have friends that want to create decks on their 'account' then they will have the option to name decks to what ever they want. This will be a new experience for me because I think I might create new folders per deck which I never done. Then again for the experience I may add in user accounts. Might look better and more practical for future improvements.

Eliminate txt files as this is the only reason I'm using php. I recently discovered XML and I could stop using PHP entirely and the user wont need a test server to run this.

# My Notes
As of right now the program doesn't have periodic mode but periodic mode will send a prompt or something to force the user to answer questions. The user will not be able to close the prompt until they answer a question correctly. 

Thinking about adding a leveling system so the user can see the progress they made while studying which could be a confident booster. I might even include a shop where they can spend points on items like skip question, reveal an answer, or something. I don't really have many item ideas yet but this could be a thing.

My current background will work for now but I really want to change the layout or something. I feel the background is bland. I'm not an artist but I can make a good judgment on what's looks better.

I am using JavaScript at the moment but I could add in some JQuery for experience and simplicity for coding.
