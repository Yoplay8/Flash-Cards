# Abstract View
This program uses Php, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am creating this program for a variety of reasons. One, I want to test my self and see what I can do. Two, Im building this program for someone. Three, I want this program to useful for others. What this program will do once finished is help someone study for a class. The user will be able to enter in their own questions which can vary from true/ false, multiple choice, or question/ answer. They will also be able to edit previously entered questions. The program will have two modes of studying. One, they can use study mode which will constantly test them against the provided questions they entered and keep track of which ones they answer wrong most frequently. Mode two will be a periodic mode. The user will be able to surf the internet and questions will be promted at set intervals. The set interval can be adjusted in the settings.

# Future Ideas
I will create a way so the user will be able to make a set of cards of individual classes. They will also have a way to combine decks to be studied up against several classes at once if they want.

# My Notes
I realize I could use other languages to make my code and or design more elegant if I used different languages. Once, again this was only for a few reasons on why I picked the language I did. If I were to use a different language I would probably pick Java or learn a little more about web development. I am not a front end developer so Im not completely familiar with all the possible languages to be used in front end development.


At the current moment if anyone reads this. I probably have a ton of grammar errors that will be fixed and this README is not complete. I wanted to start this to get something down so I had less to do when I come back to this.
